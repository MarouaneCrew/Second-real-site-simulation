Benefits of 58 Quart Cooler
You need a cooler that ensures your food and drink items stay fresh during your trip or event. The 58 Quart Cooler offers many benefits, including:

Superior cold retention: The 58 Quart Hard Cooler has the best cold retention. Thanks to the top-notch construction that ensures proper insulation, it can keep your products cold for up to 10 days.
Large storage capacity: The 58 Quart Cooler has a wide main compartment to store multiple foods and drinks. It can carry up to 72 cans or 14.5 gallons.
Extra storage area: The cooler's backside has a cargo net attachment with additional storage for other products, like paper utensils or nonperishable condiments.
Durable construction: The cooler is highly durable because of the rotational molding. This technique ensures uniform, dense plastic thick enough to endure consistent use.
Easy transportation: The 58 Quart Coolers are easy to transport with your other cargo. They have extendable flex-grip handles, so you can carry them solo or in pairs. The coolers also fit in multiple vehicle sizes, from a sedan to an SUV or truck.
Are Hard Coolers Worth It?
When deciding what type of cooler to get, consider the qualities you prefer. A hard cooler offers different benefits than a soft-sided cooler, especially if you need extra space. 

Are you going on a long trip and need to store and chill your drinks and food for an extended period? Hard coolers are the perfect choice — they can endure the elements and regular movement while keeping the interior cold. These coolers have solid plastic construction that helps them withstand exposure to weather, wildlife and movement.

A hard cooler is your optimal option when you need containers to keep your products cold for a long time. They have excellent insulation and better ice retention than soft-sided coolers, which is necessary for long trips with limited access to ice. Whether camping or hosting a party, hard coolers are ideal for their versatility and durability.
